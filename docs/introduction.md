# Introduction

The following document serves as an introduction to the iAccess for Maconomy product. The target audience is technical consultants and partners that need to install, extend, and maintain iAccess. The content is structured in the following parts:

 - In the first part, we will describe core concepts of the iAccess architecture.
 - The second part describes how it can be installed using MConfig.
 - The third part describes how it can be extended using the Maconomy Extender.
 - In the fourth part, we will provide an overview of the current extension toolkit.
 - The fifth part contains an API reference describing the facilities available in the extension toolkit.
 - Finally, the fifth part contains a migration guide, and a troubleshooting guide. Both of these guides should be particularly useful when upgrading an existing iAccess installation.
